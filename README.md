# siriproxy-arduino
Note: This is not useful any more!

A SiriProxy plugin to interface with an Arduino. Basic examples are provided for controlling the onboard LED, or alternatively, an RGB LED.

### Video
[Initial proof-of-concept](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1QvFahhBUU)

### Commands

#### LED
`Light(s) on`, `Light(s) off`

#### RGB LED
`Light(s) red`, `Light(s) blue`, `Light(s) green`

### SiriProxy Installation

Unfortunately, [SiriProxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) is poorly maintained, and will not work correctly with an iOS 6 device.

**Until SiriProxy is more regularly updated, please install SiriProxy using my fork.** 

In a terminal, `git clone http://github.com/nicoritschel/SiriProxy.git`

Follow the included README.

### siriproxy-arduino Installation

Add this to your ~/.siriproxy/config.yml file:

```yml
- name: 'Git'
  git: 'git://github.com/nicoritschel/siriproxy-arduino.git'
```

In a terminal, `siriproxy bundle`

Don't forget to upload the arduino bootstrapper to your device.

### Upload the dino Bootstrapper

 * Open [the normal Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 * Download the bootstrapper [src/du.ino](https://raw.github.com/austinbv/dino/master/src/du.ino)
 * Open the file in the Arduino IDE
 * Plug in your Arduino via USB
 * Click the upload button (an arrow)

### Credits

A big thanks goes out to @austinbv for austinbv/dino, which I rely on heavily for communicating with an Arduino
